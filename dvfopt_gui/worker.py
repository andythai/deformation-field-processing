"""Solver worker thread + state-snapshot pipeline.

The solver runs in a :class:`QThread` so the Qt event loop stays
responsive. Per-step state from the solver's ``step_callback`` hook
gets snapshotted into plain ``numpy.ndarray`` copies (the live
``jacobian_matrix`` / ``quality_matrix`` are mutated in-place by the
solver — reading them un-copied from the GUI thread would race), then
pushed onto a bounded ``queue.Queue``. The GUI's ``QTimer`` drains
the queue at ~10 Hz; older snapshots are dropped if the GUI can't keep
up. This bounds memory use and prevents render lag from slowing the
solver.

Callback contract
-----------------
``step_callback(state: dict)`` — fired by the solver after every inner
sub-iteration. ``state`` carries:

* ``phi`` — current ``(2, H, W)`` field (mutates! copy if you need it)
* ``phi_init`` — original input field, same shape (immutable)
* ``jacobian`` — current Jdet ``(1, H, W)`` (mutates! copy if you need it)
* ``quality`` — current simplex (2D) quality ``(1, H, W)`` (when enforce_*= True;
  for plain Jdet runs this is the same buffer as ``jacobian``)
* ``neg_index`` — ``(y, x)`` tuple of the current worst-Jdet target pixel
* ``window_center`` — ``(cy, cx)`` SLSQP active-window centre
* ``window_size`` — ``(sy, sx)`` SLSQP active-window dimensions
* ``opt_size`` — ``(sy', sx')`` padded optimisation window size
* ``is_padded`` — bool, True iff opt window is padded
* ``per_index_iter`` — sub-iteration index within the current pixel
* ``outer_iter`` — outer-loop iteration (one per worst-pixel target)
* ``n_neg`` — running fold count
* ``min_T`` — running minimum Jdet/triangle area
