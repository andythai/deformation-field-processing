"""Frozen-rim 3D-interior elastic-SLP mop of residual simplex (3D) folds.

The 2.5D marching sweep freezes one WHOLE slice and moves the other's
interior, so it cannot fix folds that need BOTH slices of a folded pair to
move. This mop crops a small box around each residual fold cluster, freezes
the ENTIRE rim (all six faces -> safe paste, no boundary-seam folds), and
frees the true 3D interior ``(1:D-1, 1:H-1, 1:W-1)`` of the box so both
slices move together. On a real volume it reduced the residual fold count
from 97 -> 33; the packaged ``active_band_alm_recovery_3d`` was tried for
this and FAILED on the same residuals -- this module is the working tool.

Field layout is ``(3, D, H, W)`` = ``[dz, dy, dx]``. This module operates on
``phi[1:3]`` -> a ``(2, D, H, W)`` box ``[dy, dx]``. **dz stays exactly 0
throughout** (the 2.5D precondition) -- ``phi[0]`` is never written.

Ported from ``research/strict_feasibility_3d/runners/_marching_mopup_3d_interior.py``;
all B0039 file-path / checkpoint / resume specifics removed and module
constants turned into parameters.

    Crops a small box around each residual below-threshold cluster (the

    cubes are repaired, not just negatives; ``thr3`` is the per-box LP
    target), freezes the entire rim (all six faces,
    giving a seam-safe paste), and frees the true 3D interior
    ``(1:D-1, 1:H-1, 1:W-1)`` so both slices of a folded pair move together. Each cropped box is repaired with an elastic sequential-LP
    (inter-layer simplex (3D) linearized rows + intra-slice simplex (2D) exact-violation
    acceptance, trust-region). The 2.5D precondition ``dz == 0`` is preserved:
    only ``phi[1:3]`` (``[dy, dx]``) is ever written.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phi : ndarray, shape (3, D, H, W)
        Field ``[dz, dy, dx]``. ``phi[0]`` must be (and remains) zero —
        validated up front (raises ``ValueError`` on nonzero dz or any
        non-finite value). Operated on via a copy by default -- see ``copy``.
    threshold : float, default 0.01
        The strict feasibility target for simplex (3D) volumes.
    thr3 : float or None, default None
        simplex (3D) feasibility target with margin. Defaults to
        ``threshold + 1e-4`` when None (strict target with a small margin).
    thr2 : float, default 0.01
        Intra-slice simplex (2D) area feasibility target.
    mu : float, default 1000.0
        Elastic-slack penalty weight in the per-box LP objective.
    pass_pads : sequence of (zpad, pad), default ((2, 4), (3, 6))
        Escalating ``(zpad, pad)`` schedule -- one outer pass per entry, each
        expanding cropped boxes by ``zpad`` on z and ``pad`` on y/x.
        **Kept deliberately short.** Measured on a real volume: pad=4 fixed
        most clusters, pad=6 fixed a couple more, and pads >= 9 cost
        exponentially more wall time for ZERO additional fixes (the remaining
        folds are at the geometric floor). Do NOT "helpfully" escalate this.
    dil : int, default 1
        Binary-dilation iterations used to merge nearby fold voxels into
        clusters before bounding-box extraction.
    max_iters : int, default 40
        Trust-region SLP iterations per box repair.
    dz_tol : float, default 1e-12
        Tolerance for the ``dz == 0`` precondition check.
    copy : bool, default True
        When True (the public default), operate on a float64 copy — the
        caller's array is never mutated. When False, operate on the caller's
        array directly (the caller relinquishes it; it must already be a
        float64 ``(3, D, H, W)`` array).
    verbose : int, default 0
        ``>= 1`` prints one bracketed line per pass.
    orientation_delta : float or None, default None
        Opt-in axial edge-monotonicity rows in every box LP (``None`` = off).
    n_workers : int, default 1
        ``> 1`` repairs a pass's boxes on the shared spawn pool
        (``dvfopt.core._pool.pool_map``, imported lazily unless ``pool_map``
        is given) in batches of pairwise-disjoint boxes, processed in the
        serial order — byte-identical to ``n_workers=1`` (see ``_pass``).
        ``<= 1`` is the unchanged serial loop.
    max_box : int or None, default 90
        Boxes wider than this on y or x are tiled (stride ``max_box``,
        phase-shifted by ``max_box // 2`` on even passes so seam-locked
        residuals are tile-interior next pass — the sweep's idiom). The tiles
        of one giant box are pairwise disjoint, so they run in ONE parallel
        batch instead of one worker solving the whole box for hours. Boxes
        within ``max_box`` are untouched; ``None`` disables the cap.
    stall_iters, stall_rtol : int, float, default 4, 1e-2
        Per-box futility stop (``elastic_trust_solve``): a box ends once its
        exact violation has not dropped 1 % over the last 4 LP solves. On a
        dense near-floor region nearly every tet row is active, so even a
        3.7k-voxel box is a ~50k-row LP at minutes per solve, and the
        accept-micro-step / reject alternation otherwise burns all
        ``max_iters`` (measured: one such box pinned a worker 5.4 h). ``0``
        disables the stop.

    Returns
    -------
    phi_out : ndarray
        The corrected field (a copy unless ``copy=False``).
    info : dict
        Keys: ``n_neg_before``/``n_neg_after`` (per-cube fold counts,
        ``mv <= 0``), ``n_below_before``/``n_below_after`` (per-cube
