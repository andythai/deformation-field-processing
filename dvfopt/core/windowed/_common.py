"""Windowed fold-correction engine — solves only where the folds are.

dvfopt's **third shared engine** (after ``barrier/_core.py`` and
``schwarz/_common.py``): domain decomposition orthogonal to the inner
solve, carrying no method logic of its own. Promoted from
``benchmarks/windowed_isqp.py`` (PRs #61-64).

Designed from the measured B0039 fold geometry (folds cover ~3-6.5% of a slice,
in many small clusters) rather than from any existing dvfopt loop. A full-grid
solve wastes ~95% of its work on fold-free area; this restricts each solve to a
small window around a fold cluster and freezes a context ring, so the rest of the
slice is untouched *by construction*.

Core invariant (no-damage): moving a pixel changes only constraints whose support
touches it. Every registered constraint family has finite support, so a window can
enforce *every* constraint a free pixel influences and freeze everything else — no
window solve can create a fold elsewhere. Two subtleties this module handles
explicitly:

- **Finite-difference Jdet.** ``det(I+grad phi)`` is evaluated with ``np.gradient``
  (central differences), so a constraint on a patch's *interior-cut* edge uses a
  one-sided difference that DISAGREES with the global field. Such rows are not
  enforced and their pixels are frozen. At a true image border the global field is
  ALSO one-sided there, so those rows are valid and may be enforced/freed. The
  ``damage`` report field (folds created outside every window) verifies the
  invariant held (must be 0).
- **Window coupling.** Clusters are merged (dilate-then-label) so no window's free
  set lands in another's context ring; windows are then independent and only free
  pixels are pasted back.

The "inner" contract
--------------------

Each window becomes a :class:`~dvfopt.core.windowed._inners.WindowSub` — a
frozen-ring REDUCED problem: a patch-shaped constraint clone, the patch flat
vector, ``cons``/``cons_jac`` restricted to the enforced rows (driven to
``threshold + margin_delta``), the objective triplet, and the free-variable
indices. :func:`~dvfopt.core.windowed._inners.solve_window_inner` dispatches it
by label (``'isqp'`` default / ``'slsqp'`` / ``'slsqp+trust-constr'``) and
returns ``(x_full, n_iter, feasible)``; frozen variables MUST stay at
``sub.flat0`` and only free pixels are pasted back, so the no-damage invariant
holds for any inner. This is deliberately NOT ``Strategy.fit`` on a crop — a
crop-level Strategy cannot express frozen variables or row restriction (the
seam gap ``core/slsqp_windowed`` documents in its own FOLLOW-UP comment).

Per-constraint locality (ring width, fold map, influenced rows) comes from the
:mod:`~dvfopt.core.windowed._locality` registry. The giant-region tiler
(:func:`_solve_giant_schwarz`) is windowing-specific — ring-inset overlapping
tiles with damage accounting — and deliberately does NOT reuse
``core/schwarz/_common.py``, whose crop-Strategy contract cannot freeze rings.

    (3D: every stage runs (phase 2 of the 3D port)) — by solving one small
    window per fold cluster. Returns ``(phi_out, SliceReport)``.

    ``constraint`` is a registered constraint instance
    (:class:`~dvfopt.constraints.JdetConstraint2D`,
    :class:`~dvfopt.constraints.SimplexConstraint2D`,
    :class:`~dvfopt.constraints.SimplexConstraint2DBilinear`,
    :class:`~dvfopt.constraints.FiniteJdetConstraint2D`, or
    :class:`~dvfopt.constraints.SimplexConstraint3D` — see
    :data:`~dvfopt.core.windowed._locality.LOCALITY`); ``objective`` is a
    :class:`~dvfopt.objectives.Objective` (``None`` -> ``L2Objective()``; the
    L1 smoothing eps rides on ``L1Objective(eps=...)``).

    ``max_window_area`` caps a window's free-box area; larger merged clusters are
    cleared by overlapping-tile Schwarz decomposition (``report.giant_regions``)
    instead of an intractable near-full-grid QP. ``margin`` is clamped to at least
    the family ring (the frozen inset band must stay fold-free).

    ``inner`` selects the per-window solver — ``"isqp"`` (default, the tuned
    elastic-QP SQP), ``"slsqp"``, or ``"slsqp+trust-constr"`` (see
    :func:`~dvfopt.core.windowed._inners.solve_window_inner` for the aliases).
    All inners only move the window's free pixels, so the no-damage invariant
    holds regardless of the choice.

    After the round loop plateaus, a terminal **mop** pass re-windows any residual
    with ``mop_margin`` (>> ``margin``): the diagnostic on the densest slices shows
    the plateau is boundary-stuck folds inside the giants that a small window's
    tight frozen boundary can't clear but a large frozen-exterior window can (the
    analogue of the 2.5D pipeline's ``mop_interior_3d``). ``mop_margin=0`` disables
    (3D: the margin is ``mop_margin_3d``; ``mop_margin=0`` still disables).
    ``mop_margin_3d`` (default 6) is the 3D margin — a residual cluster plus 6 per
    side is a ~13-17³ window (2.2k-4.9k voxels, around ``max_window_area`` = 3000:
    the bigger ones are solved as ONE attempt, ``ladder=False``, like a big 2D mop
    window) and always under the mop's own ``whole_cap`` of 4x that (12000 ≈ 23³),
    so it is not tiled.

    Four knobs tune the inner solves (all ``isqp``-only, defaults measured on
    the hard B0039 crops):

    - ``no_tr_fallback`` (default on) — a window that fails to reach its target
      is retried ONCE, same box, with the trust region off (legacy backtracking
      line search) before grow-on-failure. The TR ratio test freezes on
      sliver-scale violations (~1e-4, inside OSQP's own noise) that the line
      search still clears; the retry warm-starts from the failed iterate and
      keeps whichever result has the higher constraint minimum (never worse).
      ``fallback_maxiter`` is that retry's SQP iteration budget (the line search
      otherwise runs far past convergence).
    - ``qp_max_iter`` / ``qp_max_iter_fallback`` — OSQP ADMM iteration cap per
      subproblem for normal / fallback solves (``None`` = OSQP's 8000 default).
      2000/500 keeps the hard crops at zero simplex folds at ~2x the speed.
    - ``qp_backend`` (default ``'hybrid'``) / ``ip_cold`` /
      ``ip_after_admm_iters`` — which QP solver backs each subproblem.
      ``'hybrid'`` runs interior-point Clarabel on a window's cold first solve
      and after any ADMM solve that hit ``>= ip_after_admm_iters`` iterations
      (the stale-warm-start signal), warm-started OSQP otherwise: raw B0039 z16
      262 s vs 300 s (-13%), zero simplex folds, damage 0, smaller move (L2 325
      vs 346). ``'osqp'`` restores the pre-hybrid path byte for byte, and is
      what ``'hybrid'`` degrades to when ``clarabel`` is not installed. See
      :class:`dvfopt.core.primitives.isqp._HybridQP` for the policy sweep.

    ``giant_tile`` / ``giant_max_sweeps`` size the overlapping-tile Schwarz
    decomposition of an over-``max_window_area`` region: square tiles of
    ``giant_tile`` px stepped by ``giant_tile - (2 * ring + 2)``, swept at most
    ``giant_max_sweeps`` times (the sweep loop stops early once the region is
    clear or stops improving). Bigger tiles mean fewer Schwarz seams and fewer
    sweeps: on a full raw B0039 z16 slice (bilinear rows, objective ``none``)
    ``giant_tile=64`` ran 362 s / 22 windows / 1 round / no mop vs 685 s /
    264 windows / 3 rounds at 32 — 1.9x faster, zero simplex folds and zero
    damage either way, and a *smaller* move (L2 316 vs 404). 64 is the default.
    On a 3D field the tile is ``giant_tile_3d`` (default 16 per axis: 16³ voxels
    is the 2D 64² tile by count; phase 1 measured 11 s per SQP iteration at 17³
    and 69 s at 25³, so the tile must stay near 16).

    ``tr_delta`` (2.0) / ``tr_max`` (16.0) size the ``isqp`` inner's trust
    region — initial radius and cap, in grid units. The default is what every
    measured windowed number was taken at; ``tr_delta=1.0`` buys speed with
    fidelity (raw B0039 z16: 267 s / 1022 SQP iterations / L2 move 344 vs 300 s
    / 1320 / L2 325). ``tr_max`` never binds on the measured B0039 windows.

    ``step_rule`` (default ``'exact_ls'``) picks how the ``isqp`` inner turns a
    QP step into an iterate. ``'exact_ls'`` replaces the trust-region ratio
    test's accept/reject with the EXACT minimiser of the merit along the step —
    free, because the 2D rows are exactly quadratic along a line and the model's
    quadratic term reuses the ``cons(x + d)`` the ratio test already evaluates
    (see :func:`~dvfopt.core.primitives.isqp.isqp_solve`). Measured on raw B0039
    z16: 200 s / 563 SQP iterations vs 244 s / 780 at ``'tr'`` (-18% / -28%),
    0 folds, damage 0, smaller move (L2 268 vs 280); across a 9-real-slice
    sample, 9/9 wall AND iteration wins (-19% wall / -27% iterations in total)
    with a smaller L2 move on every slice. It applies on the no-trust-region
    fallback rung too — scoping it out of that rung was measured WORSE (re-measured
    on the shipped implementation: ``z0_sliver`` 1918 SQP iterations vs 1684).
    ``'tr'`` restores the ratio-test path byte for byte. ``'exact_ls'`` is
    2D-only: on a 3D field it degrades to ``'tr'`` (DEBUG log).

    ``exact_ls_fallback_steps`` (default 3, 0 = off) is what keeps ``'exact_ls'``
    from grinding on a window it cannot solve. The exact minimiser always finds
    SOME decrease, so it need not trip the ratio test's futility test and NEVER
    trips it on the no-trust-region rung (which has none) — so after this many
    consecutive steps with ``a* < 0.25`` the window stops (``exit='a-collapse'``)
    and hands itself to the escalation ladder, exactly as ``'tr-collapse'`` does.
    3 is the measured setting: it never fires on the window ``'exact_ls'`` turns
    from a 108-iteration failure into a 46-iteration solve (longest collapse run
    there: 2) and fires immediately on ``z0_sliver`` (run of 4) and ``z0_cluster``
    (6). Bilinear rows, objective ``none``, threshold 0.01, maxiter 600, engine
    defaults; **every row 0 simplex folds, damage 0**:

    ==================  =========  =========  ====================
    case                ``'tr'``   exact_ls   exact_ls + bail (3)
    ==================  =========  =========  ====================
    z16_twist (crop)    128        47         47
    z0_cluster (crop)   387        328        287
    z0_sliver (crop)    540        1684       **212**
    raw B0039 z16       780        563        **396**
    ==================  =========  =========  ====================

    (SQP iterations, coarse warm start included.) The L2 move falls too —
    z0_sliver 25.3 / 39.7 / **19.4**, raw z16 280.3 / 268.4 / **268.0** — so the
    bail is not buying speed with fidelity. Handing the remaining iterations to
    the ``'tr'`` acceptance instead of stopping was measured and is WORSE
    (z0_sliver 2350 iterations): mid-run the ratio test accepts tiny steps rather
    than rejecting them, so it grinds too. Stopping is the whole mechanism.

    ``patience_retry`` (default True) is the bail's counterpart, the LAST rung of
    the window escalation ladder before grow: a window still GENUINELY folded
    after the solve, the no-TR retry and the backend retry continues its exact-LS
    iteration from the best iterate with the bail OFF. The bail is cheap because
    the rungs above clear most windows it stops; on a window pinned by a
    prescribed correspondence whose displacement disagrees with its neighbours
    by tens of pixels (every residual cluster of the 7-brain cohort sweep sits on
    such a pin) the tiny ``a*`` steps are slow but productive and no other rung
    can continue them. Measured on a crop of the B0304 z181 residual: the full
    ladder ends folded at -0.044 after 101 s, the bail-free continuation clears
    it to +0.011 in 1 s. Real windows and mop windows only (never a giant tile),
    and never on a window that is merely short of the margin-shifted target.
    ``report.patience_fallbacks`` / ``WindowRec.patience_fallback`` count it.

    ``coarse_to_fine=True`` (default) prepends a **coarse-grid warm start**: the
    same problem is solved on a ``coarse_factor`` x coarsened field and the
    prolongated correction seeds the fine solve, so the fine windows start near a
    solution instead of cold (raw B0039 z16: 205 s / 909 SQP iterations — 841 fine
    plus a 16 s, 68-iteration coarse solve — vs 283 s / 1320 cold, at a slightly
    smaller L2 move, 320.6 vs 325.1).
    The warm-start delta is MASKED to the window free boxes the fine engine would
    open anyway, so the no-damage invariant holds unchanged and the final damage
    accounting still runs against the ORIGINAL input. It is skipped — leaving the
    path byte-identical to ``coarse_to_fine=False`` — when the field has no folds
    or when ``min(shape) < 4 * max(tile, coarse_factor)`` where ``tile`` is
    ``giant_tile`` (2D) or ``giant_tile_3d`` (3D) (below that the coarse
    problem is too small to be a meaningful preview, and its own solve is
    not amortised; the ``coarse_factor`` leg only bites for absurd factors).
    ``report.coarse_solve_s`` / ``coarse_folds_before`` / ``coarse_folds_after``
    / ``coarse_iters`` / ``warm_folds`` record the stage (``-1`` = skipped).

    ``giant_tile_fit=True`` (default) makes ``giant_tile`` a *target* rather
    than a literal size: the effective tile is fitted per region so an integer
    number of near-equal tiles covers its longest side (:func:`_fit_tile`).
    Tile size matters through grid *alignment* — the sweep-round count — not
    through size itself. ``False`` restores the literal ``giant_tile``.

    ``reanchor`` (``'none'`` — the DEFAULT, ``'l2'``, ``'l1'``) adds an optional
    **post-feasibility re-anchor stage**, opt-in because fidelity is a concern
    separate from the zero-fold certificate. With ``objective='none'`` (the robust
    recipe — pure feasibility keeps the inner out of the objective-basin traps a
    distance anchor pins it in) the correction is only close to the input by
    construction; when the field comes out feasible this stage recovers the
    fidelity, with no fold left to trap it: the MOVED region is tiled
    (``reanchor_tile`` px, overlapping), each tile is re-solved minimising the
    chosen distance to the INPUT under the same constraint rows
    (``reanchor_maxiter`` inner iterations), and a tile is kept only if every
    enforced row stays at or above ``threshold`` — otherwise it is reverted. Up to
    ``reanchor_sweeps`` sweeps, stopping once a sweep buys < 1% of the L2 move. The
    stage frees only pixels the main solve already moved, so **no-damage accounting
    is unaffected** (see :func:`_reanchor_pass`); the whole stage is reverted and a
    warning logged if a global re-check finds a fold anyway. Measured on
    already-feasible fields: B0039 z16 L2 move 76.7 -> 59.9, z0 194 -> 170, 0 folds
    throughout. ``report.reanchor_sweeps_run`` / ``reanchor_tiles`` /
    ``reanchor_accepted`` / ``reanchor_l2_before`` / ``reanchor_l2_after`` record it.

    ``orientation_delta`` (``None`` = off; a float, e.g. ``0.01``) appends the LINEAR
    orientation rows (:func:`_orientation_rows`: deformed grid edges keep a
    positive projection of at least ``orientation_delta`` on their own direction,
    plus the anti-diagonal convexity rows) to every window sub-problem. The residual
    the ladder plateaus on is a cluster driven onto the ROTATED orientation branch
    (see ``reseed_rounds``); a rotated cell violates these rows, so with them the QP
    never heads there -- prevention, where the re-seed is repair -- and they are
    linear, hence exact in the QP. Measured from raw with the re-seed off: B0304 ext
    z128 8956 -> 0 folds (3643 s, L2 1405 vs 1395 for the re-seed path), B0032 ext
    z1 4556 -> 0 in 1066 s / 1 round / 31 windows where the plain engine left 70
    after 8902 s / 374 windows (L2 1988 vs 1973). 2D simplex-family only; raises
    on other packs.

    ``giant_workers`` (default 0 = serial) solves each giant-tile sweep as
    restricted additive Schwarz on the shared spawn pool: all tiles of a sweep
    from the same snapshot concurrently, each pasting back only its disjoint
    step-grid core. Trades within-sweep propagation (possibly more sweeps) for
    parallel tiles; the serial multiplicative sweep is the default and
    byte-identical at 0.

    ``polish='l2'|'l1'`` (default None = off) adds a per-window anchored polish:
    after a window solves, the SAME box is re-solved against the distance to its
    pre-solve patch from the warm feasible point (``polish_maxiter`` inner
    iterations, the ``ftol`` stop), verify-and-revert as in the reanchor stage.
    Meant for ``objective='none'``: the cheap feasibility solve plus a short
    anchored polish, instead of anchored-QP prices for the whole fight.

    ``reseed_rounds`` (default 3, 0 = off) / ``reseed_radius`` (default 2) add a
    **terminal harmonic re-seed stage** for the residual the round loop AND the mop
    plateau on. Such residual clusters are, measured on every non-clean slice of
    the 7-brain cohort, cells whose corner images have been driven onto the
    ROTATED orientation branch (both edge factors of the area negative, product
    positive): locally fold-free, but not joinable to the surrounding field, and
    the seam between the branches is a merit MAXIMUM no local step crosses -- every
    rung, step rule and trust radius fails there identically. The stage resets the
    branch: each residual cluster's neighbourhood (its cells' corner pixels
    dilated by ``reseed_radius``) is replaced by the discrete-harmonic
    interpolation of its ring, and the engine polishes the re-seeded field
    (recursively, with this stage off). Up to ``reseed_rounds`` rounds. Measured
    on the five plateaued cohort slices (29-79 residual cells each, every rung
    exhausted): **0 simplex and 0 bilinear folds on all five, damage 0, 10-40 s**.
    The re-seeded pixels are fold neighbourhoods, and the polish's windows join
    ``touched``, so the no-damage invariant is unchanged; the stage never fires on
    a field the mop cleared, so those runs are byte-identical.
    ``report.reseed_rounds_run`` / ``reseed_px`` / ``reseed_folds_before`` /
    ``reseed_folds_after`` record it.

    ``time_budget_s`` (``None`` = unlimited) is checked at round boundaries and
    before each window solve; on expiry the engine stops, logs a warning, and
    finishes accounting on the best-so-far field. ``record_history=True`` fills
    ``report.history`` with per-stage convergence entries; ``step_callback``
    receives ``{'phi': ..., 'stage': ...}`` snapshots after each round / giant /
    mop (``KeyboardInterrupt`` propagates as the documented Stop). All three are
    no-ops at their defaults — the default path is byte-identical to the
    promoted benchmark driver. ``verbose`` reserves the standard solver
    verbosity contract (the engine itself emits no progress lines; warnings
    surface through the ``dvfopt`` logger regardless).

    #   target reports not-ok while being perfectly fold-free. Since

    #   `threshold` exactly when `cons < -margin_delta`.

    #   attempt per tile defeats tiling for the same reason growing one does: the
    #   Schwarz loop already re-sweeps a tile that ends folded, and the terminal mop
    #   re-windows whatever survives with a large margin (mop windows DO take this
