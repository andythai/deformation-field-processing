# Architecture

Rules for extending `dvfopt`, not a module census. For *what exists*, read
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); for *where it moved in 0.5.0*, read
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Three axes

A solve is the composition of three independent choices:

```
              Constraint                 Objective              Strategy
     "what must stay feasible"      "what to minimise"      "how to get there"
   SimplexConstraint2D / -3D ...     L1 / L2 / NoneObjective   SLP, Barrier, SLSQP*, ...
                 │                          │                       │
                 └──────────────┬───────────┴───────────────────────┘
                                ▼
                       Solver(constraint=, objective=, strategy=).fit(phi)
                                ▼
                          (phi_out, SolveInfo)
```

Any triple that type-checks is runnable. A Strategy declares what it can
actually take (`accepts_constraints`, `accepts_objectives`, `supports_3d`) and
`Solver.__init__` rejects a bad triple at construction with
`IncompatibleConstraintError` / `IncompatibleObjectiveError` — never mid-solve.

`Solver.from_spec(constraint='simplex', objective='l1', strategy='slp')` builds the
same thing from string labels via the three registries.

The most robust from-raw triple currently known is
`correct_dvf(phi, constraint='bilinear', strategy='isqp_windowed', objective='none')`
— bilinear feasibility implies simplex feasibility (its 4 rows/cell contain the 2
simplex rows), and pure feasibility keeps the windowed isqp out of the
objective-basin traps a distance anchor pins it in. The one-call recipe, the
engine defaults behind it and the measured dead ends are written up in
[docs/recipe-2d-zero-folds.md](docs/recipe-2d-zero-folds.md).

`auto_strategy` routes to it: `'bilinear'` → `'isqp_windowed'` at any objective
the engine accepts and at every fold tier, and `'simplex_standard'` → the same
under `objective='none'`. It is never substituted for an L1/L2 request — that is
a different fidelity ask, so `simplex` + `l1` keeps `'slp'` (and logs a one-line
hint). Every such route needs `osqp`; without it the case falls through to the
fold-density tier heuristic. `'simplex'` (full coverage) has no windowed-engine
locality entry, so only `'simplex_standard'` takes the `none` route. 3D routing
is unchanged.

Across a volume, the DVFopt facade
parallelises the per-slice loop with `DVFoptConfig(n_workers=N)` (process
pool; slices are independent solves). Every pool in the package pins its workers
to one compute thread each (`dvfopt.core._pool.pin_worker_threads` /
`pinned_thread_env`) — numpy and scipy otherwise start a full-width
OpenBLAS/OpenMP pool *each* (53 OS threads per worker, measured). Keep `N`
**small — 2-4, not the core count**: the solves are memory-bandwidth bound, so
measured throughput peaks at ~2.6x around 4 workers and *declines* past that,
on a 16-physical-core box. See the CHANGELOG for the measured tables.

The **simplex metric** (labels `'simplex'` / `'simplex_standard'` / `'simplex_3d'`; formerly *2-tri* / *6-tet*) is the exact Jacobian determinant of the piecewise-linear interpolant on the fixed simplicial decomposition of the grid — 2 triangles per cell along the fixed BL–TR diagonal in 2D, 6 tetrahedra per cell in 3D — so feasibility is a genuine injectivity certificate for that interpolant. Strictness ordering: central-diff Jdet < `'finite'` (forward-diff = one triangle per cell) < simplex (both triangles). The old names *2-tri* / *6-tet* remain as registry aliases (`'2tri'`, `'2tri_standard'`, `'6tet'`, `'6tet_3d'`), and the old class names (`TriConstraint2D`, `TriConstraint2DFullCoverage`, `TriConstraint2DBilinear`, `Tet6Constraint3D`) remain importable.

## Dependency rules

Imports flow one way. Breaking these is what re-tangles the package.

| Layer | May import | Must NOT import |
|---|---|---|
| `dvfopt/objectives.py` | numpy only | anything in `dvfopt.core` |
| `dvfopt/constraints.py` | `core.primitives.*`, `jacobian.*` | any `core/<method>/` package |
| `dvfopt/core/primitives/` | numpy/scipy, `dvfopt.objectives` | any `core/<method>/`, `strategies`, `solver` |
| `dvfopt/core/<method>/` | `core.primitives.*`, the shared engines, `dvfopt.objectives`, a sibling's *public* entry point (see below) | a sibling's private internals, `strategies`, `solver` |
| `dvfopt/strategies/<name>.py` | `constraints`, `objectives`, its own `core/<method>/` | another strategy's core package |
| `dvfopt/solver.py`, `unified.py`, `pipeline_*.py`, `cli.py` | all of the above | — |

- **Method packages are siblings, not a chain.** `core/barrier/`,
  `core/slsqp_windowed/`, `core/slsqp_fullgrid/`, `core/schwarz/`,
  `core/wallbreakers/`, `core/slp/`, `core/nmvf/`, `core/marching/` all depend
  on `core/primitives/` and on the shared engines. A **composite** method
  may additionally call a sibling's *public* function as an explicit pipeline
  phase or seed — the wallbreakers run `barrier.tri2d` as a polish phase, SLP
  seeds from `wallbreakers`, `marching` reuses `slp.tri_linearize`. What is
  forbidden is reaching into a sibling's private internals or re-deriving its
  math; shared math moves to `core/primitives/` instead.
  *(Known debt: the barrier drivers borrow io/metrics helpers —
  `_setup_accumulators`, `_print_summary`, `_init_phi_3d`, `_update_metrics_3d` —
  from `slsqp_windowed.coordinator*`. Those are generic run-bookkeeping, not
  windowed-SLSQP logic; they are candidates to move into shared infra.)*
- **The three shared engines** are `core/barrier/_core.py`
  (`run_penalty_barrier_lbfgs`, the penalty→barrier homotopy),
  `core/schwarz/_common.py` (`cluster_schwarz_2d_tri` / `cluster_schwarz_3d_tet`,
  the domain decomposition), and `core/windowed/_common.py` (`windowed_correct`,
  the cluster-windowed no-damage decomposition — frozen-ring windows around fold
  clusters with a label-selected inner solver). Any method package may import
  these; they carry no method logic of their own.
  *(Windowed escalation order, isqp inner: solve → **no-trust-region retry**
  (`no_tr_fallback`, warm-started from the failed iterate, `fallback_maxiter`
  SQP iterations) → **backend retry** (`qp_backend='hybrid'` only: a real
  window — never a giant tile — left GENUINELY folded is re-attempted whole on
  plain OSQP from its ORIGINAL start state, since the interior-point trajectory
  is what led astray) → grow-on-failure → giant tiling / mop. The TR ratio test
  freezes on sliver-scale violations the legacy line search clears. OSQP ADMM
  iterations are capped per subproblem — `qp_max_iter` / `qp_max_iter_fallback`.
  Measured: a cap-escalation ladder over these is slower and no more feasible;
  do not add one. The QP itself is solved by `qp_backend` (default `'hybrid'`):
  interior-point Clarabel on a window's cold first solve and after any ADMM run
  of `>= ip_after_admm_iters` (800) iterations, warm-started OSQP otherwise —
  raw B0039 z16 262 s vs 300 s at 0 simplex folds / damage 0. Clarabel-*always*
  is slower (381 s): a warm-started ADMM solve averages 0.175 s, so IP only pays
  where the warm start is cold or stale. `'osqp'` reproduces the pre-hybrid
  path byte for byte and is the automatic degradation when `clarabel` is
  absent. The backend retry above is what keeps hybrid's feasibility equal to
  osqp's; it is free on the full slice (every candidate there is a tile) and
  essential on small crops, where growing cannot recover the basin. The giant tiler's tile size / sweep cap are `giant_tile`
  (default 64) / `giant_max_sweeps`: 64 measured 1.9x faster than 32 on a full
  raw B0039 slice at equal feasibility and a smaller move. `giant_tile_fit`
  (default on) makes that a *target*, fitted per region so an integer number of
  near-equal tiles covers its longest side: tile size acts through grid
  ALIGNMENT — the sweep-round count — not through size, so a target that leaves
  a remainder strip costs an extra round. `coarse_to_fine` (default on) prepends
  a warm start: the same problem solved on a `coarse_factor`x coarsened field,
  its correction prolongated back and MASKED to the free boxes `find_windows`
  opens on the fine fold mask — that mask is what preserves the no-damage
  invariant (the warm start moves only pixels the engine would free anyway) and
  the final damage accounting still runs against the ORIGINAL input. Raw B0039
  z16: 205 s / 909 SQP iterations (841 fine + a 16 s, 68-iteration coarse solve)
  vs 283 s / 1320 cold — same fold count (0), same damage (0), slightly smaller
  move (L2 320.6 vs 325.1). It is
  skipped on a fold-free field or when `min(H, W) < 4 * giant_tile`, so small
  crops keep the cold path byte for byte. The isqp trust region is sized by
  `tr_delta` (2.0) / `tr_max` (16.0), no longer hard-coded; `tr_delta=1.0` runs
  267 s / 1022 iterations but at L2 move 344 — speed bought with fidelity,
  which coarse-to-fine is not. `step_rule` (default `'exact_ls'`) picks how a QP
  step becomes an iterate: the EXACT minimiser of the merit along the step
  rather than the ratio test's accept/reject. It is exact because the 2D rows are
  bilinear in `(dy, dx)`, hence exactly quadratic along a line, and free because
  the model's quadratic term `q = cons(x + d) - c - J d` reuses the `cons(x + d)`
  the ratio test already evaluates — no per-family Hessian table, no extra
  constraint evaluation. Raw B0039 z16: 200 s / 563 SQP iterations vs 244 s /
  780 at `'tr'`, 0 folds, damage 0, smaller move (L2 268 vs 280); 9/9 wall AND
  iteration wins over a 9-real-slice sample, -19% wall / -27% iterations. Only the objective
  part of the line model is fitted (from `obj` at a = 0, 1/2, 1 — exact for
  L2/none, approximate for L1), so the TRUE merit at `a*` is checked before the
  step and the iteration falls back to the `'tr'` acceptance otherwise. The
  ratio test's futility threshold is KEPT as the `tr-collapse` trigger — an exact
  minimiser always finds some decrease, so without it a hopeless window grinds
  instead of escalating. That threshold is *relative* to the QP's predicted
  decrease and is absent entirely on the no-trust-region rung, so
  `exact_ls_fallback_steps` (default 3) adds the absolute signal: after that many
  consecutive steps with `a* < 0.25` the window STOPS (`exit='a-collapse'`) and
  hands itself to the escalation ladder. That is what removed the one documented
  `exact_ls` regression — `z0_sliver` 1684 -> 212 SQP iterations (`'tr'`: 540) —
  while raw B0039 z16 also fell 563 -> 396 and every case's L2 move shrank (five
  real slices: 3515 -> 2869 iterations, -18%, none regressing on either axis).
  Stopping is the mechanism: handing the remaining iterations to the `'tr'`
  ACCEPTANCE instead was measured worse (2350), because mid-run the ratio test
  accepts tiny steps rather than rejecting them. 2D only (a 6-tet row is cubic
  along a line), degraded to `'tr'` at `windowed_correct`'s entry on 3D, so the
  patience rung (`step_rule == 'exact_ls'`-gated) stays off in 3D. The cubic
  line model that would make it exact in 3D was built and REFUTED in phase 3 (wins
  the sparse crops, loses the dense ones and the 17^3 whole window; CHANGELOG). The maximal fold-free step
  cap tried alongside it is REFUTED — it strangles the elastic mechanism; do not
  add one, and do not scope `exact_ls` out of the no-TR rung (re-measured on the
  shipped implementation: 1918 vs 1684 on `z0_sliver`).
  `reanchor` (default `'none'`) appends an optional **post-feasibility
  re-anchor stage**. The robust recipe's `objective='none'` buys its trap-free
  feasibility by carrying no fidelity term at all, so once the field is
  fold-free this stage tiles the MOVED region and re-solves each tile against
  the distance-to-INPUT objective (`'l2'` / `'l1'`), keeping a tile only if
  every enforced row stays at or above `threshold` and the tile actually
  reduced the distance. Each tile's free set is intersected with the moved mask
  (`build_subproblem(..., free_extra=)`), so the stage only moves pixels the
  main solve already moved — the no-damage accounting is unchanged — and the
  whole stage is reverted if a global re-check finds a fold anyway. Opt-in:
  fidelity is a concern separate from the zero-fold certificate.)*
- **Objectives are pure.** An `Objective` is `(diff) -> (value, grad)` and
  nothing else — no state, no constraint knowledge, no I/O. Kernels that cannot
  call back into Python (numba, torch autograd) take the legacy
  `(kind, eps_l1)` pair from `objectives._kind_eps(objective)` instead.
- **Strategies own no math.** A strategy is argument marshalling plus one call
  into its `core/<method>/` package, then `self._finish(...)` to normalise the
  return into `(phi_out, SolveInfo)`.

## phi-pack conventions

Two flat layouts exist. Crossing them silently swaps dy/dx and produces a
plausible-looking wrong answer, so the layout is declared on the Constraint
(`Constraint.pack`) and every helper assumes exactly one of them.

| Pack | Layout | Declared by | Modules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PhiPack.DY_FIRST` | `phi[:N]=dy`, `phi[N:]=dx` | `SimplexConstraint2D`, `SimplexConstraint2DFullCoverage`, `SimplexConstraint2DBilinear` | `core/primitives/tri.py`, `core/barrier/tri2d.py`, `core/slsqp_fullgrid/tri2d.py`, `core/schwarz/{tri2d,_cluster}.py`, the 2D `core/wallbreakers/*`, `core/slp/{lp_direct_2tri,cluster_lp_2tri,tri_linearize}.py` |
| `PhiPack.DX_FIRST` | `phi[:N]=dx`, `phi[N:2N]=dy` (3D: `phi[2N:]=dz`) | `JdetConstraint2D`, `JdetConstraint3D`, **`SimplexConstraint3D`** | `core/slsqp_windowed/*`, `core/primitives/{jdet2d,jdet3d}.py`, `core/barrier/{jdet2d,jdet3d,jdet3d_torch,tet3d_torch}.py`, `core/slsqp_fullgrid/tet3d.py`, `core/slp/{lp_direct_6tet,cluster_lp_6tet}.py`, the 3D `core/wallbreakers/*`, `jacobian/tetrahedron_sign.py` |

Note the split is **not** "simplex vs Jdet": the 3D simplex family packs
`[dx, dy, dz]` so it can share the 3D barrier plumbing with `JdetConstraint3D`.
`core/schwarz/_common.py` is pack-agnostic (it slices `(C, *shape)` arrays and
never flattens).

A flat vector from one family cannot be handed to the other without a channel
swap. A helper that genuinely sees both — `core/marching/*` mixes a DX_FIRST
simplex (3D) stack with a DY_FIRST simplex (2D) term — asserts on the pack lengths at the
boundary. Copy that pattern; do not bridge silently.

## Add a method

1. **`dvfopt/core/<name>/`** — a package, not a loose module. Public entry
   point(s) re-exported from its `__init__.py`; helpers underscore-prefixed.
   Constraint math comes from `core/primitives/`; reuse an engine if the method
   is a penalty/barrier homotopy or a Schwarz decomposition. No sibling-method
   imports.
2. **`dvfopt/strategies/<name>.py`** — a `@dataclass` `Strategy` subclass
   decorated with `@register_strategy('<label>')`, its knobs as dataclass
   fields. Declare `accepts_constraints`, `accepts_objectives`, `supports_3d`
   (omit an `accepts_*` to accept anything). `solve()` marshals arguments, calls
   into `core/<name>/`, and returns `self._finish(out, record_history, threshold)`.
   Import it from `dvfopt/strategies/__init__.py` so the registration runs.
3. **`tests/test_<name>.py`** — at minimum: direct composition through
   `Solver`, resolution by string label, and rejection of a constraint or
   objective the strategy declares it does not accept.
4. **GUI (optional)** — three rows, all parity-tested by
   `tests/test_gui_strategy_parity.py`: a `worker._MID_TO_LABEL` entry mapping
   menu id → registry label, the matching menu-spec row, and the table row.
   Miss one and that test fails.
5. **Docs** — a row in the CLAUDE.md strategy→impl delegation table.

If the method is a variant of an existing one (a different seed, a different
schedule), it is a **dataclass field on the existing Strategy**, not a new
package.

## Add a constraint

1. Subclass `Constraint` in `dvfopt/constraints.py`.
2. Implement `values()`, `adjoint(v)`, `flatten(arr)`, `unflatten(phi)`.
   Add `jacobian()` only if an SLSQP strategy will consume it (SLSQP needs the
   sparse rows; barrier/SLP need only the adjoint).
3. Declare `pack` (`PhiPack.DY_FIRST` or `PhiPack.DX_FIRST`) and `dim`.
   The pack declaration is the contract every strategy trusts.
4. `@register_constraint('<label>')` so `from_spec` / the CLI / the GUI can
   name it.
5. Put the flat constraint evaluation + analytic adjoint in
   `core/primitives/`, not in the constraint class — solvers call the primitive
   directly on hot paths.

*Footnote: support in the windowed engine (`windowed_correct` /
`ISQPWindowedStrategy`) additionally needs a `WindowLocality` entry in
`core/windowed/_locality.py` (ring width, fold map, influenced rows). Folding
that registry into `Constraint` itself is a stage-2 candidate.*

## Add an objective

Subclass `Objective`, implement `__call__(diff) -> (value, grad)`, set `label`.
That is the whole contract — no other method is called on an objective.

If the objective must reach the numba/torch inner kernels, it also needs a
`label` (and `eps`, if smoothed) that `_kind_eps` can map to a kind string;
those kernels dispatch on an integer flag and cannot evaluate Python.
